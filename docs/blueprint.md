# **App Name**: Noble Health

## Core Features:

- Homepage Navigation: Navbar with links to Home, Services, Areas We Serve, Blog, and Work with Us, plus 'Free Care Consultation' and 'Call Us' buttons. Responsive design adapts to mobile with a hamburger menu.
- Hero Section: A landing page with a title, subtitle, and a ZIP code form for users to find care nearby. The page includes an image of a caregiver and patient or a suitable background, displayed appropriately on desktop and mobile.
- Informative Cards: Display six informative cards, each featuring an icon, title, and brief text, arranged in a responsive grid (3x2 on desktop, 1x6 on mobile), highlighting key aspects such as care types or core values.
- Call-to-Action Button: A prominent, centrally-located button with the text 'FREE CARE CONSULTATION' to encourage user engagement.
- Mini Form: Implement a compact version of the form (as a final question). Use a horizontal layout on desktop and a vertical, stacked layout on mobile devices for enhanced readability. It will lead to more extensive forms.
- Service Carousel: An automatically scrolling carousel displaying care service options, where each service name, accompanied by an icon or image, is a clickable link to a page

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft, muted teal (#70A19F) to evoke feelings of trust and tranquility.
- Background color: Very light teal (#E0F4F3), close to white, providing a clean and unobtrusive backdrop that maintains a feeling of brand cohesion.
- Accent color: Muted green (#6B9362) that harmonizes with the primary, but differs enough to make the interactive elements pop.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern serif font providing elegance, while body text will use 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) to ensure optimal readability in longer passages.
- Simple, modern icons to represent different care services and navigation items. The style should be consistent and easily recognizable.
- Clean and responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. Use of white space to create a sense of calm and order.
- Subtle animations and transitions to enhance user experience without being distracting. For example, a gentle fade-in effect when loading new content, or a smooth transition when navigating between sections.
